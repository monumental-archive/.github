# The tooling verdict register

Every SLSA/OpenSSF-adjacent tool the org has considered, with verdict,
reason and re-examination trigger — written once, here, so a settled
decision stops being re-litigated and a stranger's "why not X?" is
answerable by a link (#213). Where another document argues a verdict
at length, this register links rather than restates; where a verdict
existed only in a closed PR or an issue body, this is now its record.

The general priors behind most rows: zero standing infrastructure
(nothing in the org runs and stays up), keyless identity (no
self-held key custody), aqua-backed tools with checksums and
attestations, and a single-maintainer headcount that some doors are
honestly blocked on.

## Adopted, or adopted-in-equivalent

| Tool | Discharges |
| --- | --- |
| mise + aqua belt (`mise/config.toml` + lock) | Pinned, checksummed, attestation-verified toolchain, org-wide |
| Sigstore keyless (cosign, `actions/attest`) | All signing: provenance, VSAs, VEX, source chain |
| GitHub attestation store + evidence bundles | Provenance distribution (Build L1/L2) |
| cargo-deny | Advisory gate in `ci`; the release path's refusal mechanism |
| cargo-auditable | Dependency tree in-artifact; the SBOM's image-side closure |
| trivy | Published-image scanning by digest, misconfig + secrets in the gate |
| zizmor (offline in gate, online in audit) + actionlint | Workflow hygiene, the capability-boundary's supporting cast |
| OpenSSF Scorecard (org-owned workflow) | The external report card; publishes because monitoring beats blindness |
| CodeQL (org security configuration) | Code scanning across the org |
| rekor-monitor (org-owned workflow) | Transparency-log watch for forged signer identities — the reason the id-token rule was narrowed |
| Renovate (org preset, zero-age canon fan-out) | Pin freshness; the release-age quarantine |
| OSV via `audit:blast-radius` | Malicious-package and advisory sweep over every published SBOM |

**shellcheck, retained despite the abandonment flag** (#290 finding 6).
Renovate's `abandonments:recommended` sweep flags shellcheck (last
release 2025-08-04) as past the abandonment threshold. Verdict:
retained, as a written exception rather than a silent one. shellcheck
is mature and feature-complete — a slow release cadence is its normal,
not its death — and it is the only engine actionlint can delegate
`run:` script analysis to, so dropping it would lower the belt's
enforcement to add none back. The exposure is also small: it parses
the org's own tracked scripts, offline, with no network surface.
*Reopen:* a shellcheck CVE, aqua dropping or freezing the package,
actionlint growing or switching script engines, or a maintained fork
becoming the community's canonical line.

**Renovate `customManagers`: preset and repo arrays concatenate, never
replace** (#314). The open question that issue punted — whether a repo
defining its own `customManagers` while extending `default.json` would
silently drop the preset's lefthook and preset-ref managers — is
settled by Renovate's documented merge semantics: `customManagers` is a
*mergeable* list option, so values "will be added to any existing
object or array that existed with the same name". A repo's array
supplements the preset's; nothing is dropped. The signer-pin manager
this verdict originally governed is now **deleted along with its file**
(#316 finding 2): the manager's URL package name (`git-refs` needs one)
could not match the first-party group's `monumental-archive/**` glob,
so every signer bump split into two branches neither of which could go
green — the canon now states the trusted signer only in its `uses:`
lines, like every consumer, and `verify-release.yml` derives the
verdict identity from them. The merge-semantics fact stands for any
future custom manager. *Reopen:* a value that genuinely cannot live in
a natively-managed representation.

## Skipped, with rationale and reopen trigger

- **Allstar / Minder** — continuous org-policy enforcement services.
  The org enforces settings as code (`settings/repo-baseline.sh`,
  org rulesets) and audits drift on Mondays with zero standing
  infrastructure. *Reopen:* drift the Monday audit structurally cannot
  see, or an org too large for a weekly sweep.
- **witness / Archivista** — in-toto attestation framework plus a
  standing attestation store. The GitHub attestation store already
  serves every consumer recipe, and Archivista is a service to keep
  up. *Reopen:* attestation needs the GitHub store cannot express
  (cross-org graphs, non-GitHub consumers at volume).
- **FRSCA / Tekton Chains** — a different build platform with signing
  in its control plane. The org's platform is GitHub Actions with the
  signer split providing the same property. *Reopen:* leaving GitHub
  Actions.
- **sigstore policy-controller** — admission control for Kubernetes.
  The org operates no cluster; verification happens at consumption via
  documented recipes. *Reopen:* an org-operated deployment surface.
- **cargo-audit** — skipped-subsumed: same RustSec DB, strictly a
  subset of `cargo deny check advisories`
  ([`dependency-track.md`](dependency-track.md), recorded verdicts).
- **cargo-crev** — web-of-trust dependency review. Same boundary as
  cargo-vet below: with one maintainer the web has one node.
  *Reopen:* with cargo-vet.
- **cargo-vet + cackle** — the L4-track pair. The corrected record
  (#203): cargo-vet is **not** technically sequenced behind anything —
  it needs no vendoring and could run tomorrow. Its blocker is
  headcount: one maintainer becomes the auditor of last resort and
  Renovate queues behind a reading list
  ([`dependency-track.md`](dependency-track.md), #122). *Reopen:* a
  second maintainer.
- **cffconvert** — `CITATION.cff` validation. Not needed, and recorded
  now because the scaffold previously cited a verdict that was never
  made (#316): the file is generated — `fix:citation` renders it from
  `REUSE.toml`, `lint:citation` diffs the committed file against a
  fresh render — so the generator is its own validator, and a schema
  checker would only re-verify constants the generator wrote. *Reopen:*
  hand-authored CFF fields beyond `title`, or a consumer requiring CFF
  features the generator does not emit.
- **ClusterFuzzLite** — unnecessary for any targeted score, with a
  real cost surface ([`slsa-reference.md`](slsa-reference.md)).
  *Reopen:* fuzzing becomes a target (Best Practices beyond the
  current aim).
- **harden-runner** — retracted deliberately after measured breakage;
  required by nothing the org targets; the full argument lives in
  [`release.md`](release.md) ("No runner-hardening agent"). *Reopen:*
  SLSA promotes hermeticity into an actual level — and then derive
  allowlists from audit data, never by construction.
- **gittuf** — v1.2 names it explicitly as an implementation route for
  Identity Management and Protected Named References, and the verdict
  survives that: it substitutes for the ruleset half the org already
  satisfies platform-anchored, **emits no source VSAs** (so it could
  never have moved the level), and its self-held threshold keys
  reintroduce the key custody the keyless design removed — a threshold
  root with one maintainer is a threshold of one
  ([`slsa-reference.md`](slsa-reference.md)). *Reopen:* a second
  maintainer AND a platform-compromise threat model above the org's
  risk line.
- **slsa-github-generator** — deprecated upstream as of 2026-08-07;
  never adopted; the signer split provides the property it existed
  for.
- **upstream `source-tool`** — stood up and proven in the lab, parked
  on four upstream defects, ultimately not adopted as issuer: the org
  built its own emitter (#207). Lives on as a *candidate cross-check*
  of our VSAs, never their issuer — watched as #199.

## Watched, as filed issues

The trigger lives on the issue, not duplicated here:
[#124](https://github.com/monumental-archive/.github/issues/124)
(GUAC — blast-radius insufficiency, not time),
[#125](https://github.com/monumental-archive/.github/issues/125)
(BuildEnv L2+ — GitHub shipping runner attestation),
[#126](https://github.com/monumental-archive/.github/issues/126)
(Source L4 — a second maintainer, nothing else),
[#168](https://github.com/monumental-archive/.github/issues/168)
(PVTR — recurring Baseline drift),
[#199](https://github.com/monumental-archive/.github/issues/199)
(source-tool as cross-check).

## Neither adopted nor skipped: unreachable

- **`SLSA_BUILD_REPRODUCED`** — requires provenance from two or more
  independently operated build platforms. `repro-check` rebuilds on
  the same platform *by design* (skew-proofing is what makes a
  mismatch mean nondeterminism), so this architecture cannot earn the
  property and nothing here may ever label it so
  ([`slsa-reference.md`](slsa-reference.md)). Recorded as unreachable
  rather than watched: no trigger short of a second build platform
  changes it, and that would be an architecture decision, not a tool
  adoption.
- **`SLSA_SOURCE_TWO_PARTY_REVIEWED`** — headcount-blocked, the Source
  L4 boundary; watched via #126 rather than here.
